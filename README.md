## About This Project

FOSSBilling Webuzo Server Manager is an open source server management extension currently in development, designed to integrate Webuzo servers directly into the FOSSBilling platform.

The goal is to provide a clean, reliable, and maintainable way for hosting providers and developers to provision and manage Webuzo environments from within FOSSBilling.

The objective is to deliver a practical and extensible integration that can be relied upon in real hosting environments.

This repository will track development progress and eventually host the complete open source codebase.

## Current Status

The project is in early planning and architecture design.

Initial focus areas include:

- Webuzo server provisioning  
- Account lifecycle management  
- Automation within FOSSBilling workflows  
- Clean and extensible module structure  

A public roadmap will be published as development milestones are defined.
